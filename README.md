## What is Compoglot?
Compoglot is a tool that allows developers to easily create localizations in a variety of different languages without necessarily knowing them. Compoglot uses a programming language as it's input which restricts the user to a vocabulary and grammar that is common between the supported output languages. As this programming language is explicit and without ambiguities, the localizations created by Compoglot are generally quite accurate.
