## What is Compoglot?
Compoglot allows developers to create sentences in a variety of different languages through the use of a programming language which restricts the user to a vocabulary and grammar that is common between the supported output languages.

Repeated use of compoglot allows developers to create localizations in without knowing the target language. As Compoglot's input language is restictive, explicit, and without ambiguities, the localizations created by Compoglot are generally quite accurate.
