#THIS REPOSITORY IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT

This repository served as a testing ground for this idea, to find out whether it would, or would not work. This project is now being properly redesigned, and completely rewritten at: https://github.com/CoolAs/compoglot

## What is Compoglot?
Compoglot defines a subset of natural language that is common between a variety of different natural languages.  Perfect machine translations can be made from this common subset into these natural languages with the compoglot tool, allowing developers to create localisations for a variety of different languages, without knowing every single language that they wish to target.

The compoglot language is extremely explicit. It has separate definitions in its language for every separate meaning. This means that it has at least two different translations for the English word "glass", one for the material (The window is made of glass), and one for the drinking instrument (I drink out of a glass). As these two different meanings may have different words or spellings related to them in different languages, they have different entries in the compoglot language. This (along with many other explicit features) allows for accurate machine translation from compoglot's language to a natural language.

Note that the compoglot code doesn't change in all of the examples, only the language name.


## What languages does compoglot support?
English, German and Esperanto
