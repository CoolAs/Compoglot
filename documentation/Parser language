To begin a parsed line you need to open and close a bracket. For example:
 "()"
This will create a blank line in any language, it will possibly add a punctuation mark.

There are then multiple functions that are called within multiple sentence parts. They are as follows.

n: Defines a noun. Uses the following arguments:
   id  		- int - Is the identifier of the noun. It is the line number that the noun can be found on.
   num 		- int - The number of the noun, if the noun is plural. It should be one higher or lower (if negative) than the desired number, as 0 is a blank number.
   reflex 	- bool - True if the pronoun should be a reflexive one. Can be ignored for non-pronouns
   plural	- bool - True if the noun should be plural.
   typ 		- int - The type of article that should be prepended to the noun.
